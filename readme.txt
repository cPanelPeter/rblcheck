rblcheck - a simple command line script to check your main IP and any ipaliases against a list
of RBL's (Realtime Blackhole Lists).  

A WHM plugin was also created with this code to be used in a walkthrough.

How to use this from the command line:

Either download the code from github.com:

# curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cPanelPeter/rblcheck/master/rblcheck > /root/rblcheck

or set up an alias:

alias rblcheck="/usr/bin/perl <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cPanelPeter/rblcheck/master/rblcheck)"

Call it with the following options: 

-bash-4.1# ./rblcheck 
rblcheck
   --allips checks all IP addresses on the server.
   --listips lists all IP addresses on the server.
   --listrbls lists all RBL's that can be checked.
   --rbl [RBL NAME] check only the RBL selected. Can have multiple --rbl values.
   --listedonly only displays information if an IP address is listed in an RBL.
   --checkip [IP ADDRESS] - checks an IP address not associated with this server
   --mail - sends email to the root user account if any IP is found to be listed. 
   --help (you're looking at it!)

So to check the servers main IP address to see if it's listed on any RBL's you might enter: 

-bash-4.1# ./rblcheck --listedonly
Checking IP 208.xx.xxx.xx

cbl.abuseat.org: [LISTED] (127.0.0.2)
    \_ Reason: "Blocked - see http://www.abuseat.org/lookup.cgi?ip=208.xx.xxx.xx"
cidr.bl.mcafee.com: [LISTED] (127.0.0.4)
    \_ Reason: "https://www.spamhaus.org/query/ip/208.xx.xxx.xx"
rbl.rbldns.ru: [LISTED] (127.0.0.2)
    \_ Reason: "RBLDNS Server v1.0. Author VDV [ Site: WWW.RBLDNS.RU ]"
zz.countries.nerd.dk: [LISTED] (127.0.3.72)
    \_ Reason: "us"

Checked 248 Realtime Blackhole Lists (RBL's) & found 208.xx.xxx.xx listed in 4 of them.


You can also set up a daily or weekly cron job.

0 23 * * * /root/rblcheck --listedonly --mail 

Example of passing an RBL to check using the --rbl option: 


-bash-4.1# ./rblcheck --listedonly --rbl zen.spamhaus.org --rbl bl.spamcop.net

This would only check the 2 RBL's passed on the command line to see if the servers main IP 
address is listed.
